# Shawn Kristek, Software Engineer Portfolio

Hi, I'm Shawn Kristek. I am ready and willing to tackle anything software related. This project is an early portfolio that I have updated to include recent career highlights. I consider the underlying code outdated and in need of a performance overhaul, but perfectly functional. 

When I started this project I utilized a design template by [BootstrapMade](https://bootstrapmade.com/free-html-bootstrap-template-my-resume/) that I then adapted to the technologies I wanted to learn. Leveraging the UI of this template I adapted the project to run as a Flask app.
