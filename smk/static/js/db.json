One of his favorite ways to give back was to hire college students to provide them with a pay check and work experience for their resumes. He was in need of a web presence and branding so I built him a Wordpress site as well as set up his social media profiles. Many students since then have worked on his web presence, but much of my work for the overall site theme, branding, and functionality is still present.",
